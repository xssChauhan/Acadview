 There are Two lists 
 A = [1,2,3,4,5]

 Write a program to make one single list out of the two. So the result looks like:

Thereâ€™s a dictionary:
A = { 1:1 ,2:2 ,3:3 ,4:4 , 5:5 }
Write a program to convert the dictionary into a list such that the entry each key-value 
	Pair occurs as a list. so 1:1 is made into [1,1]
	So the result should look like this:
		[ [1,1] , [2,2] ,[3,3] , [4,4] , [5,5] ]
